# Testing discord voice receive

This repo is just for me to test receving voice input from discord voice chats via a bot and discord.js.
I tried with discord.py, but that doesn't support this functionality apparently, so back to javascript xD

# Setting up the current state of this project for testing

1. fill out all fields in `template.env` and rename the file to `.env`
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run deploy`
4. run `npm start`
5. works (idk really... not tested yet... I'll document this properly someday... until then, be a lil patient will you?)
